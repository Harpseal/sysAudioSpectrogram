# [MicSpectrogram]

This is a sample windows app which visualizes mic waveform as spectrogram by using kissFFT and FFTW.


## Todo
```
Indicate music scale.
Frequency-dB line chart.
Replace highgui with LayeredWindowD2D
```

## Buliding Prerequisites & Dependencies
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 Express
* OpenCV (In this project, it only uses the highgui of OpenCV to creating window and showing FFT results. Highgui will be replace with LayeredWindowD2D in the future.)
* KissFFT
* FFTW (Optional)
