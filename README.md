# sysAudioSpectrogram

This is a sample **windows** project which visualizes system [WASAPI loopback capture](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/matthew_van_eerde/archive/2008/12/16/sample-wasapi-loopback-capture-record-what-you-hear.aspx) as spectrogram by using kissFFT and FFTW. The motivation of this project is try to figure out the relation between the frequency and the music. If you has the same question, the book "[Mathematics and Music](http://www.math.wustl.edu/~wright/Math109/00Book.pdf)" is recommended.


## Todo
```
Indicate music scale. ex.A440 (pending)
Replace highgui with LayeredWindowD2D (in process)
Frequency-dB line chart. (almost done)
```


## Buliding Prerequisites & Dependencies
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 Express
- OpenCV 
	- In this project, I only use the highgui to create UI window and show some FFT results. Highgui will be replace with LayeredWindowD2D(Windows API) in the future.
- KissFFT
- FFTW (Optional)

So you'll probably need to install the Windows SDK before playing around with the source code, legally.
